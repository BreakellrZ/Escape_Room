              <h3>-So, what exactly is an escape room?-</h3>

              <p class="p_info">
                An escape room, is a themed room where players are locked in and
                have 60 minutes to escape. Themes can vary from prison cells to
                haunted mansions to luxury train stations any theme is possible
                in an escape room which makes every new escape room experience
                different and unique. Players escape by solving puzlles and
                tasks. Each puzzle you solve you will get a clue to solve the
                next one and eventually it will lead to you escaping the room.

              <h3>-Essential tips for first timers-</h3>

              <p class="p_info">
                Choose your best team ! You are allowed up to eight people in
                most escape rooms but I recommened no more then four. The more
                people the more chaotic it can get. The ideal amount of people
                per escape room is between two to four.
              </p>

              <p class="p_info">
                Listen carefully to your gamemaster (The gamemaster is who will
                bring you into the game - they are watching over your game and
                can assist you if you get stuck) At the beggining of every
                escape game the Gamemaster will go over a breefing on the room
                and the back story behind the room. Listen carefully for early
                clues.
              </p>

              <p class="p_info">
                Communication is the most important tip - Constantly talk and
                let people know what clues you have found, who knows mabye they
                are looking for the exact item you picked up!

                Escape rooms are not like anything else, enjoy them and most
                importanly have fun. They are great for all ages and all levels
                of problem-solving. Remember you dont have to be Albert
                Eninstein to solve the puzzles but you might feel like him once
