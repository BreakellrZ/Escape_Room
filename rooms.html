            Imagine a world where the Earth's electromagnetic field has been
            reversed. The protective shield between the Earth and Space gone,
            electric grids malfunctioning, blackouts lasting for decades... You
            live in times where probability of such events is extremely high.
            Earth's electromagnetic field is overdue for a flip. Days of the
            World as we know it are numbered. All hopes on taking appropriate
            preventive measures when confronting the reversal effects rest on
            the shoulders of Professor Prism, the world's leading expert on
            electromagnetism. When he does not arrive to the conference to
            deliver his lecture, you know something is wrong. Worried, you come
            to check on the professor in his office only to discover you have
            been deceived and lured into the room of doom…
