Irelands Escape Rooms is a website on some of Irelands top escape rooms. This website was created for fun to showcase people in Ireland some of my favourite rooms. The website has three pages.
1. Home page showcasing some basic information on escape rooms in Ireland and a YouTube video on escape rooms 101.
2. Rooms page showcasing the top Irish escape rooms with pictures, location and info on the specific rooms themselves.
3. F.A.Q Page with frequently asked questions and answers. With a fourm that users can fill in if they wish to contact me for extra information on escape rooms.
